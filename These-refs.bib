###### HOW-TO ######

To add a new entry in your bibliography chose the proper template below, copy-
paste it in the end of this file, replace the "_" by an "at-symbol" (this
symbol cannot be typed here otherwise the bibliography processing program
would think there's an entry inside this how-to), and fill its fields. Check
an proper entry example in the end of this file.

You can use the month macros (jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep,
oct, nov, dec) WITHOUT QUOTES to let the bib-style handle the language of the
month (French or English), like in the example in the end of the file.

Optional fields in the templates are commented out with a '%'. Note that not
all external programs that process bibliography information in .bib files
support comments inside the reference entry (notably bibtex doesn't), so you
may need to remove the fields you don't want/need in your entry instead of
leaving it commented out. Moreover, anything not starting with a "at-symbol"
is normally not processed by the bibliography processing program (like it was
just comments).

Among them, human-awareness has gain lot of attention in the last years due to its important role in human safety and robot acceptance. The proposed robot navigation system extends state of the navigation schemes with some social skills in order to naturally integrate the robot motion in crowded areas. Learning has been proposed as a more principled way of estimating the insights of human social interactions. To do this, inverse reinforcement learning is used to derive social cost functions by observing persons walking through the streets. Our objective is to incorporate such costs into the robot navigation stack in order to “emulate” these human interactions. In order to alleviate the complexity, the system is focused on learning an adequate cost function to be applied at the local navigation level, thus providing direct low-level controls to the robot. The paper presents an analysis of the results in a robot navigating in challenging real scenarios, analyzing and comparing this approach with other algorithms.},

	abstract = {Mobility in an effective and socially-compliant manner is an essential yet challenging task for robots operating in crowded spaces. Recent works have shown the power of deep reinforcement learning techniques to learn socially cooperative policies. However, their cooperation ability deteriorates as the crowd grows since they typically relax the problem as a one-way Human-Robot interaction problem. In this work, we want to go beyond first-order Human-Robot interaction and more explicitly model Crowd-Robot Interaction (CRI). We propose to (i) rethink pairwise interactions with a self-attention mechanism, and (ii) jointly model Human-Robot as well as Human-Human interactions in the deep reinforcement learning framework. Our model captures the Human-Human interactions occurring in dense crowds that indirectly affects the robot's anticipation capability. Our proposed attentive pooling mechanism learns the collective importance of neighboring humans with respect to their future states. Various experiments demonstrate that our model can anticipate human dynamics and navigate in crowds with time efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

   robots. Manipulation, perception, and most importantly human-robot interaction are some of the skills in which navigation might rely on. This paper is focused on the dependence on human-robot interaction and uses two particular scenarios of growing complexity as an example: asking for collaboration to enter a room and asking for permission to navigate between two people which are talking. In the ﬁrst scenario, the person physically blocks the path to the adjacent room, so it would be impossible for the robot to navigate to such room. Even though in the second scenario the people talking do not block the path to the other room, from a social point of view, interrupting an ongoing conversation without noticing is undesirable. In this paper we propose a navigation planning domain and a set of software agents which allow the robot to navigate in crowded environments in a socially acceptable way, asking for cooperation or permission when necessary. The paper provides quantitative experimental results including social navigation metrics and the results of a Likert-scale satisfaction questionnaire.},

	abstract = {When mobile robots maneuver near people, they run the risk of rudely blocking their paths; but not all people behave the same around robots. People that have not noticed the robot are the most difficult to predict. This paper investigates how mobile robots can generate acceptable paths in dynamic environments by predicting human behavior. Here, human behavior may include both physical and mental behavior, we focus on the latter. We introduce a simple safe interaction model: when a human seems unaware of the robot, it should avoid going too close. In this study, people around robots are detected and tracked using sensor fusion and filtering techniques. To handle uncertainties in the dynamic environment, a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process Model (POMDP) is used to formulate a navigation planning problem in the shared environment. People's awareness of robots is inferred and included as a state and reward model in the POMDP. The proposed planner enables a robot to change its navigation plan based on its perception of each person's robot-awareness. As far as we can tell, this is a new capability.

The primary idea of the proposed algorithm is to incorporate obstacles information (position and motion), human states (human position, human motion), social interactions (human group, human-object interaction), and social rules, e.g, minimum distances from the robot to regular obstacles, individuals, and human groups into the deep reinforcement learning model of a mobile robot. We then distribute the mobile robot into a dynamic social environment and let the mobile robot automatically learn to adapt to an embedded environment by its experiences gained through trial-and-error social interactions with the surrounding humans and objects. When the learning phase is completed, the mobile robot is able to navigate autonomously in the social environment while guaranteeing human safety and comfort with its socially acceptable behaviours.},

	abstract = {Safe and social navigation is the key to deploying a mobile service robot in a human-centered environment. Widespread acceptability of mobile service robots in daily life is hindered by robot's inability to navigate in crowded and dynamic human environments in a socially acceptable way that would guarantee human safety and comfort. In this paper, we propose an effective proactive social motion model (PSMM) that enables a mobile service robot to navigate safely and socially in crowded and dynamic environments. The proposed method considers not only human states (position, orientation, motion, field of view, and hand poses) relative to the robot but also social interactive information about human-object and human group interactions. This allows development of the PSMM that consists of elements of an extended social force model and a hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle technique. The PSMM is then combined with a path planning technique to generate a motion planning system that drives a mobile robot in a socially acceptable manner and produces respectful and polite behaviors akin to human movements. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, we validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed proactive social motion model (PSMM) through both simulation and real-world experiments under the newly proposed human comfortable safety indices. To do that, we first implemented the entire navigation system using the open-source robot operating system. We then installed it in a simulated robot model and conducted experiments in a simulated shopping mall-like environment to verify its effectiveness. We also installed the proposed algorithm on our mobile robot platform and conducted experiments in our office-like laboratory environment. Our results show that the developed socially aware navigation framework allows a mobile robot to navigate safely, socially, and proactively while guaranteeing human safety and comfort in crowded and dynamic environments. In this paper, we examined the proposed PSMM with a set of predefined parameters selected based on our empirical experiences about the robot mechanism and selected social environment. However, in fact a mobile robot might need to adapt to various contextual and cultural situations in different social environments. Thus, it should be equipped with an online adaptive interactive learning mechanism allowing the robot to learn to auto-adjust their parameters according to such embedded environments. Using machine learning techniques, e.g., inverse reinforcement learning [1] to optimize the parameter set for the PSMM could be a promising research direction to improve adaptability of mobile service robots in different social environments. In the future, we will evaluate the proposed framework based on a wider variety of scenarios, particularly those with different social interaction situations and dynamic environments. Furthermore, various kinds of social cues and signals introduced in [2] and [3] will be applied to extend the proposed framework in more complicated social situations and contexts. Last but not least, we will investigate different machine learning techniques and incorporate them in the PSMM in order to allow the robot to automatically adapt to diverse social environments.},

	abstract = {Considering the widespread use of mobile robots in different parts of society, it is important to provide them with the capability to behave in a socially acceptable manner. Therefore, a research topic of great importance recently has been the study of Human-Robot Interaction. Autonomous navigation is a fundamental task in Robotics, and several different strategies that produce paths that are either length or time optimized can be found in the literature. However, considering the recent use of mobile robots in a more social context, the use of such classical techniques is restricted. Therefore, in this article we present a social navigation approach considering environments with groups of people. The proposal uses a density function to efﬁciently represent groups of people, and modify the navigation architecture in order to include the social behaviour of the robot during its motion. This architecture is based on the combined use of the Probabilistic Road Mapping (PRM) and the Rapidlyexploring Random Tree (RRT) path planners and an adaptation of the elastic band algorithm. Experimental evaluation was carried out in different simulated environments, providing insight on the performance of the proposed technique, which surpasses classical techniques with no proxemics awareness in terms of social impact.},

Therefore, robots should firstly apprehend their space similarly with the people and, secondly, should adopt human motion anticipation strategies in their planning mechanism. The paper at hand introduces a closed-loop human oriented robot navigation strategy, where on-board a moving robot, multimodal human detection and tracking methods are deployed to predict human motion intention in the shared workspace. The human occupied space is probabilistically constrained following the proxemics theory. The impact of human presence in the commonly shared space is imprinted to the robot’s navigation behaviour after undergoing a social filtering step based on the inferred walking pattern. The proposed method has been integrated with a robotic platform and extensively evaluated in terms of socially acceptable behaviour in real-life experiments exhibiting increased navigation capacity in human populated environments.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study if modeling can help discriminate actions which in turn can be used to select an appropriate behavior for a mobile robot. For human-human interaction, significant social and communicative information can be derived from interpersonal distance between two or more people. If Human-Robot Interaction reflects this human-human interaction property, then interpersonal distance between a human and a robot may contain similar social and communicative information. An effective robot's actions, including actions associated with interpersonal distance, must be suitable for a given social circumstance. Studying interpersonal distance between a robot and a human is very important for assistive robots. We use autonomously detected features to develop such an interpersonal model using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and demonstrate that such a learned model can discriminate different human actions. The proposed approach can be used in a socially-aware planner to weight trajectories and select actions that are socially appropriate for a given social situation.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of navigating a mobile robot through dense human crowds. We begin by exploring a fundamental impediment to classical motion planning algorithms called the ‘‘freezing robot problem’’: once the environment surpasses a certain level of dynamic complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. We argue that this problem can be avoided if the robot anticipates human cooperation, and accordingly we develop interacting Gaussian processes, a prediction density that captures cooperative collision avoidance, and a ‘‘multiple goal’’ extension that models the goal-driven nature of human decision making. We validate this model with an empirical study of robot navigation in dense human crowds (488 runs), specifically testing how cooperation models effect navigation performance. The multiple goal interacting Gaussian processes algorithm performs comparably with human teleoperators in crowd densities nearing 0.8 humans/m2, while a state-of-theart non-cooperative planner exhibits unsafe behavior more than three times as often as the multiple goal extension, and twice as often as the basic interacting Gaussian process approach. Furthermore, a reactive planner based on the widely used dynamic window approach proves insufficient for crowd densities above 0.55 people/m2. We also show that our noncooperative planner or our reactive planner capture the salient characteristics of nearly any dynamic navigation algorithm. Based on these experimental results and theoretical observations, we conclude that a cooperation model is critical for safe and efficient robot navigation in dense human crowds.},
