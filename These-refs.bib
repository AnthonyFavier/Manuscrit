	abstract = {The domain of human-robot Joint Action is a growing ﬁeld where roboticists, psychologists and philosophers start to collaborate in order to devise robot abilities that are as efﬁcient and convenient for the human partner as possible. Besides studying Joint Action and developing algorithms and schemes to control the robot and manage the interaction, one of the current challenges is to come up with a method to properly evaluate the progresses made by the community. Several questionnaires have already been proposed to the community that deal with the evaluation of humanrobot interaction. However, these studies mainly concern either speciﬁc basic behaviors during Joint Action or human-robot interactions without effective physical Joint Action. When it comes to high level decisions during physical human-robot Joint Action, there are fewer contributions to the topic, and also, the methods to evaluate them are even rarer. The aim of this paper is to propose a reusable questionnaire PeRDITA (Pertinence of Robot Decisions In joinT Action) allowing us to evaluate the pertinence of high level decision abilities of a robot during physical Joint Action with a human.},
