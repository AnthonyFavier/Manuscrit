Besides studying Joint Action and developing algorithms and schemes to control the robot and manage the interaction, one of the current challenges is to come up with a method to properly evaluate the progresses made by the community. Several questionnaires have already been proposed to the community that deal with the evaluation of humanrobot interaction. However, these studies mainly concern either speciﬁc basic behaviors during Joint Action or human-robot interactions without effective physical Joint Action. When it comes to high level decisions during physical human-robot Joint Action, there are fewer contributions to the topic, and also, the methods to evaluate them are even rarer. The aim of this paper is to propose a reusable questionnaire PeRDITA (Pertinence of Robot Decisions In joinT Action) allowing us to evaluate the pertinence of high level decision abilities of a robot during physical Joint Action with a human.},

	doi = {10.3389/frobt.2023.1149439},
	abstract = {Many real-world robotic applications such as search and rescue, disaster relief, and inspection operations are often set in unstructured environments with a restricted or unreliable communication infrastructure. In such environments, a multi-robot system must either be deployed to i) remain constantly connected, hence sacrificing operational efficiency or ii) allow disconnections considering when and how to regroup. In communication-restricted environments, we insist that the latter approach is desired to achieve a robust and predictable method for cooperative planning. One of the main challenges in achieving this goal is that optimal planning in partially unknown environments without communication requires an intractable sequence of possibilities. To solve this problem, we propose a novel epistemic planning approach for propagating beliefs about the system’s states during communication loss to ensure cooperative operations. Typically used for discrete multi-player games or natural language processing, epistemic planning is a powerful representation of reasoning through events, actions, and belief revisions, given new information. Most robot applications use traditional planning to interact with their immediate environment and only consider knowledge of their own state. By including an epistemic notion in planning, a robot may enact depth-of-reasoning about the system’s state, analyzing its beliefs about each robot in the system. In this method, a set of possible beliefs about other robots in the system are propagated using a Frontier-based planner to accomplish the coverage objective. As disconnections occur, each robot tracks beliefs about the system state and reasons about multiple objectives: i) coverage of the environment, ii) dissemination of new observations, and iii) possible information sharing from other robots. A task allocation optimization algorithm with gossip protocol is used in conjunction with the epistemic planning mechanism to locally optimize all three objectives, considering that in a partially unknown environment, the belief propagation may not be safe or possible to follow and that another robot may be attempting an information relay using the belief state. Results indicate that our framework performs better than the standard solution for communication restrictions and even shows similar performance to simulations with no communication limitations. Extensive experiments provide evidence of the framework’s performance in real-world scenarios.},

	abstract = {In communication restricted environments, a multi-robot system can be deployed to either: i) maintain constant communication but potentially sacriﬁce operational eﬃciency due to proximity constraints or ii) allow disconnections to increase environmental coverage eﬃciency, challenges on how, when, and where to reconnect (rendezvous problem). In this work we tackle the latter problem and notice that most stateof-the-art methods assume that robots will be able to execute a predetermined plan; however system failures and changes in environmental conditions can cause the robots to deviate from the plan with cascading eﬀects across the multi-robot system. This paper proposes a coordinated epistemic prediction and planning framework to achieve consensus without communicating for exploration and coverage, task discovery and completion, and rendezvous applications. Dynamic epistemic logic is the principal component implemented to allow robots to propagate belief states and empathize with other agents. Propagation of belief states and subsequent coverage of the environment is achieved via a frontier-based method within an artiﬁcial physics-based framework. The proposed framework is validated with both simulations and experiments with unmanned ground vehicles in various cluttered environments.},

	abstract = {Epistemic planning plays an important role in multi-agent and human-agent interaction domains. Most existing works solve multi-agent epistemic planning problems by either precompiling them into classical planning problems; or, using explicit actions and their effects to encode Kripke-based semantics. A recent approach called Planning with Perspectives (PWP) delegates epistemic reasoning in planning to external functions using F-STRIPS, keeping the search within the planning algorithm and lazily evaluating epistemic formulae. Although PWP is expressive and efﬁcient, it models S5 epistemic logic and does not support belief, including false belief. In this paper, we extend the PWP model to handle multi-agent belief by following the intuition that agents believe something they have seen until they see otherwise. We call this justiﬁed perspectives. We formalise this notion of multi-agent belief based on the deﬁnition of knowledge in PWP. Using experiments on existing epistemic and doxastic planning benchmarks, we show that our belief planner can solve benchmarks more efﬁciently than the state-of-theart baseline, and can model some problems that are infeasible to model using propositional-based approaches.},

	abstract = {Theory of mind refers to the human ability to reason about mental content of other people such as beliefs, desires, and goals. In everyday life, people rely on their theory of mind to understand, explain, and predict the behaviour of others. Having a theory of mind is especially useful when people collaborate, since individuals can then reason on what the other individual knows as well as what reasoning they might do. Realization of hybrid intelligence, where an agent collaborates with a human, will require the agent to be able to do similar reasoning through computational theory of mind. Accordingly, this paper provides a mechanism for computational theory of mind based on abstractions of single beliefs into higher-level concepts. These concepts can correspond to social norms, roles, as well as values. Their use in decision making serves as a heuristic to choose among interactions, thus facilitating collaboration on decisions. Using examples from the medical domain, we demonstrate how having such a theory of mind enables an agent to interact with humans efficiently and can increase the quality of the decisions humans make.},

	abstract = {Theory of Mind (ToM) is a psychological construct that captures the ability to ascribe mental states to others and then use those representations for explaining and predicting behavior. We review recent progress in endowing artificially intelligent robots with ToM. A broad array of modeling, experimental, and benchmarking approaches and methods are present in the extant literature. Unlike other domains of human cognition for which research has achieved super-human capabilities, ToM for robots lacks a unified construct and is not consistently benchmarked or validated—realities which possibly hinder progress in this domain. We argue that this is, at least in part, due to inconsistent defining of ToM, no presence of a unifying modeling construct, and the absence of a shared data resource. We believe these would improve the ability of the research community to compare the ToM abilities of different systems. We suggest that establishing a shared definition of ToM, creating a shared data resource that supports consistent benchmarking \& validation, and developing a generalized modeling tool are critical steps towards giving robots ToM capabilities that lay observers will recognize as such.},

	abstract = {Humans and robots are increasingly working together in human-robot teams. Teamwork requires communication, especially when interdependence between team members is high. In previous work, we identified a conceptual difference between sharing what you are doing (i.e., being transparent) and why you are doing it (i.e., being explainable). Although the second might sound better, it is important to avoid information overload. Therefore, an online experiment (n = 72) was conducted to study the effect of communication style of a robot (silent, transparent, explainable, or adaptive based on time pressure and relevancy) on human-robot teamwork. We examined the effects of these communication styles on trust in the robot, workload during the task, situation awareness, reliance on the robot, human contribution during the task, human communication frequency, and team performance. Moreover, we included two levels of interdependence between human and robot (high vs. low), since mutual dependency might influence which communication style is best. Participants collaborated with a virtual robot during two simulated search and rescue tasks varying in their level of interdependence. Results confirm that in general robot communication results in more trust in and understanding of the robot, while showing no evidence of a higher workload when the robot communicates or adds explanations to being transparent. Providing explanations, however, did result in more reliance on RescueBot. Furthermore, compared to being silent, only being explainable results a higher situation awareness when interdependence is high. Results further show that being highly interdependent decreases trust, reliance, and team performance while increasing workload and situation awareness. High interdependence also increases human communication if the robot is not silent, human rescue contribution if the robot does not provide explanations, and the strength of the positive association between situation awareness and team performance. From these results, we can conclude that robot communication is crucial for human-robot teamwork, and that important differences exist between being transparent, explainable, or adaptive. Our findings also highlight the fundamental importance of interdependence in studies on explainability in robots.},

	abstract = {The concept of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) describes innovative industrial work procedures, in which human staff works in close vicinity with robots on a shared task. Current HRC scenarios often deploy hand-guided robots or remote controls operated by the human collaboration partner. As HRC envisions active collaboration between both parties, ongoing research efforts aim to enhance the capabilities of industrial robots not only in the technical dimension but also in the robot’s socio-interactive features. Apart from enabling the robot to autonomously complete the respective shared task in conjunction with a human partner, one essential aspect lifted from the group collaboration among humans is the communication between both entities. State-of-the-art research has identified communication as a significant contributor to successful collaboration between humans and industrial robots. Non-verbal gestures have been shown to be contributing aspect in conveying the respective state of the robot during the collaboration procedure. Research indicates that, depending on the viewing perspective, the usage of non-verbal gestures in humans can impact the interpersonal attribution of certain characteristics. Applied to collaborative robots such as the Yumi IRB 14000, which is equipped with two arms, specifically to mimic human actions, the perception of the robots’ non-verbal behavior can affect the collaboration. Most important in this context are dominance emitting gestures by the robot that can reinforce negative attitudes towards robots, thus hampering the users’ willingness and effectiveness to collaborate with the robot. By using a 3 × 3 within-subjects design online study, we investigated the effect of dominance gestures (Akimbo, crossing arms, and large arm spread) working in a standing position with an average male height, working in a standing position with an average female height, and working in a seated position on the perception of dominance of the robot. Overall 115 participants (58 female and 57 male) with an average age of 23 years evaluated nine videos of the robot. Results indicated that all presented gestures affect a person’s perception of the robot in regards to its perceived characteristics and willingness to cooperate with the robot. The data also showed participants’ increased attribution of dominance based on the presented viewing perspective.},

This paper aims at reproducing such a scenario in a humanrobot collaboration setting by proposing a novel communication control architecture. Exploiting control barrier functions, the robot is made aware of its (dynamic) skills and limits and, thanks to a local predictor, it is able to assess if it is possible to execute a requested task and, if not, to propose alternative by relaxing some constraints. The controller is interfaced with a communication infrastructure that enables human and robot to set up a bidirectional communication about the task to execute and the human to take an informed decision on the behavior of the robot. A comparative experimental validation is proposed.},

It is one of the most fundamental capabilities of intelligent mobile robots. This paper presents a standardized testbed with a set of environments and metrics to benchmark difﬁculty of different scenarios and performance of different systems of metric ground navigation. Current benchmarks focus on individual components of mobile robot navigation, such as perception and state estimation, but the navigation performance as a whole is rarely measured in a systematic and standardized fashion. As a result, navigation systems are usually tested and compared in an ad hoc manner, such as in one or two manually chosen environments. The introduced benchmark provides a general testbed for ground robot navigation in a metric world. The Benchmark for Autonomous Robot Navigation (BARN) dataset includes 300 navigation environments, which are ordered by a set of difﬁculty metrics. Navigation performance can be tested and compared in those environments in a systematic and objective fashion. This benchmark can be used to predict navigation difﬁculty of a new environment, compare navigation systems, and potentially serve as a cost function and a curriculum for planning-based and learningbased navigation systems.

Humans concurrently aid and comply with each other while moving in a shared space. Cooperation helps pedestrians to efﬁciently reach their own goals and respect conventions such as the personal space of others. To meet human comparable efﬁciency, a robot needs to predict the human trajectories and plan its own trajectory correspondingly in the same shared space. In this work, we present a navigation planner that is able to plan such cooperative trajectories, simultaneously enforcing the robot’s kinematic constraints and avoiding other non-human dynamic obstacles. Using robust social constraints of projected time to a possible future collision, compatibility of human-robot motion direction, and proxemics, our planner is able to replicate human-like navigation behavior not only in open spaces but also in conﬁned areas. Besides adapting the robot trajectory, the planner is also able to proactively propose co-navigation solutions by jointly computing human and robot trajectories within the same optimization framework. We demonstrate richness and performance of the cooperative planner with simulated and real world experiments on multiple interactive navigation scenarios.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in modeling complex activities that occur in a typical household. We propose to use programs, i.e., sequences of atomic actions and interactions, as a high level representation of complex tasks. Programs are interesting because they provide a non-ambiguous representation of a task, and allow agents to execute them. However, nowadays, there is no database providing this type of information. Towards this goal, we ﬁrst crowd-source programs for a variety of activities that happen in people’s homes, via a game-like interface used for teaching kids how to code. Using the collected dataset, we show how we can learn to extract programs directly from natural language descriptions or from videos. We then implement the most common atomic (inter)actions in the Unity3D game engine, and use our programs to “drive” an artiﬁcial agent to execute tasks in a simulated household environment. Our VirtualHome simulator allows us to create a large activity video dataset with rich ground-truth, enabling training and testing of video understanding models. We further showcase examples of our agent performing tasks in our VirtualHome based on language descriptions.},

	abstract = {Many times the simulation environment is an ad hoc implementation done with the single purpose of testing the author’s algorithm or methodology. It is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd that the accuracy of the simulation is low and mostly unable to reﬂect the real world. While, under certain circumstances, that can be a valid approach there is the need of a simulation environment where the focus is on the physical realism while retaining a lot of conﬁgurability so that it can be adapted to a lot of diﬀerent uses. In this paper it is presented a simulation environment where multiple kinds of robots can be modeled. The robots can be modeled based on a network of physical bodies interconnected by joints that can be powered, or not, by electrical motors. The corresponding low level controllers and the high level decision or IA can also be implemented in the simulation environment. To achieve that, some established open source libraries like the Open Dynamics Engine are used. The parameters for the physical simulation are all accessible when deﬁning the robot model and a very accurate motor model can also be implemented. There is also the ability to use external modules to implement the high level controllers.},

	abstract = {The PackBots being used by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and the urban search and rescue (USAR) robots that worked the World Trade Center site are just two recent examples of mobile robots moving from the laboratory to the field. What is significant about these new applications is that they invariably involve some form of human-robot interaction (HRI) rather than the full robot autonomy that has motivated most prior research. Conducting HRI research can be extremely difficult because experimentation with physical robots is expensive and time consuming. Few roboticists have experience or interest in conducting human experimentation, and researchers in human factors or human-computer interaction often lack experience in programming robots or access to robotic platforms. In this paper, we describe a high-fidelity, open-source simulation intended for HRI researchers of varying backgrounds and provide reference tasks and environments to facilitate collaboration in order to share the results. The architecture and capabilities of the game engine–based USARSim simulation are described. Its use for HRI research is illustrated through case studies describing experiments in camera control for remote viewing and integrated display of attitude information.},

	abstract = {The last five years marked a surge in interest for and use of smart robots, which operate in dynamic and unstructured environments and might interact with humans. We posit that well-validated computer simulation can provide a virtual proving ground that in many cases is instrumental in understanding safely, faster, at lower costs, and more thoroughly how the robots of the future should be designed and controlled for safe operation and improved performance. Against this backdrop, we discuss how simulation can help in robotics, barriers that currently prevent its broad adoption, and potential steps that can eliminate some of these barriers. The points and recommendations made concern the following simulation-in-robotics aspects: simulation of the dynamics of the robot; simulation of the virtual world; simulation of the sensing of this virtual world; simulation of the interaction between the human and the robot; and, in less depth, simulation of the communication between robots. This Perspectives contribution summarizes the points of view that coalesced during a 2018 National Science Foundation/Department of Defense/National Institute for Standards and Technology workshop dedicated to the topic at hand. The meeting brought together participants from a range of organizations, disciplines, and application fields, with expertise at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and physics-based simulation.},

Therefore, a virtual reality (VR) simulation with a virtual robot may offer an alternative to real-life HRI studies. Like a real intelligent robot, a virtual robot can utilize the same advanced algorithms to behave autonomously. This paper introduces HAVEN (HRI-based Augmentation in a Virtual robot Environment using uNity), a VR simulation that enables users to interact with a virtual robot. The goal of this system design is to enable researchers to conduct HRI Augmented Reality studies using a virtual robot without being in a real environment. This framework also introduces two common HRI experiment designs: a hallway passing scenario and humanrobot team object retrieval scenario. Both reﬂect HAVEN’s potential as a tool for future AR-based HRI studies.},

Virtual reality (VR) offers an attractive alternative as it provides visual cues that are more similar to the real world. In this paper, we explore how virtual reality mediates human-robot interactions through two user studies. The ﬁrst study shows that in situations where perception of the robot is challenging, a VR display provides signiﬁcantly improved performance on a collaborative task. The second study shows that this improved performance is primarily due to stereo cues. Together, the ﬁndings of these studies suggest that VR displays can offer users unique perceptual beneﬁts in simulated robotics applications.},

	abstract = {Work-related musculoskeletal disorders in industry represent a major health problem in many developed countries. Collaborative robotics, which allows the joint manipulation of objects by both a robot and a person, is a possible solution. But efficiently designing such assistive robots requires to assess the ergonomic benefit they offer. Similarly to other domains such as automotive or workstation design, the use of a digital human simulation (DHS) can cut down the development cost and time by replacing the physical mock-up with a virtual one easier to modify. However, simulating human-robot collaborative tasks poses specific challenges because the human and the robot form a highly coupled dynamic system in which the motion of each partner depends on the forces exchanged. Therefore a dynamic simulation is required to obtain reliable measurements for ergonomic assessments. The first part of this chapter details the challenges of DHS for collaborative robotics. State-of-the-art work on DHS with collaborative robots is reviewed to identify which questions currently remain open. An optimization-based controller is then proposed to animate a digital human model (DHM) in the context of human-robot collaboration. The second part of this chapter presents an application of the DHM controller. A human-robot collaborative task is successfully simulated and allows to quantify the effect of kinematic, dynamic and control parameters of the robot on the DHM posture and effort.},

We also show that the semantics provides us with a valuable tool to analyze and to suggest corrections for the conversational policies.},

For instance, a temporary absence or inattention of the human can entail a partial, and potentially not sufﬁcient, knowledge about the current situation. To ensure a successful and ﬂuent execution of the shared plan the robot might need to detect such situations and be able to provide the information to its human partner about what he missed without being annoying or intrusive. To do so, we have developed a framework which allows a robot to estimate the other agents mental states not only about the environment but also about the state of goals, plans and actions and to take them into account when executing human-robot shared plans.},

We propose SAM, an architecture which leverages temporal knowledge represented as relations in Allen’s interval algebra and constraint-based temporal planning techniques. SAM provides two key capabilities for contextualized service provision: human activity recognition and planning for controlling pervasive actuation devices. While drawing inspiration from several state-of-the-art approaches, SAM provides a unique feature which has thus far not been addressed in the literature, namely the seamless integration of these two key capabilities. It does so by leveraging a constraint-based reasoning paradigm whereby both requirements for recognition and for planning/execution are represented as constraints and reasoned upon continuously.},

We modify the standard Behavior Trees (BTs) formulation in order to take into account the action-related costs, and design suitable metrics and cost functions to account for the cooperation with a worker considering human availability, decisions, and ergonomics. The developed approach allows the robot to online adapt its plan to the human partner, by choosing the tasks that minimize the execution cost(s). Through simulations, we ﬁrst tuned the weights of the cost function for a realistic scenario. Subsequently, the developed method is validated through a proofof-concept experiment representing the boxing of 4 diﬀerent objects. The results show that the proposed cost-based BTs, along with the deﬁned costs, enable the robot to online react and plan new tasks according to the dynamic changes of the environment, in terms of human presence and intentions. Our results indicate that the proposed solution demonstrates high potential in increasing robot reactivity and ﬂexibility while, at the same time, in optimizing the decision-making process according to human actions.},
