\section{Introduction}

why simulation: HRI rebuttal: we rely on a reactive execution, real life robot are slow and not very reactive thus may bias our results

\section{Related work}
of plan+execution, simulator

\section{Description}
planning is same

execution is based on model of execution and mock components

human collaborates in real time with robot in blockwords task

describe simulator, mouse, robot and human capabilities, goal shown, prompt

\section{Study protocol}

objective, participants, material, experiment design, procedure, measures
