\section{Introduction}

We would want the robot to be able to reason and maintain correctly the distinct human beliefs. Despite modeling distinct beliefs, HATP/EHDA doesn't maintain in a principled way, only in a scripted way (domain specific). Here we propose some models and algorithms to integrated some concept of Theory of Mind in the planning process of HATP/EHDA.
