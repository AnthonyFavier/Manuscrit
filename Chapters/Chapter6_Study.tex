\section{Introduction}

To validate the approach presented in the previous chapter we conducted a user study on more than twenty participants. The purpose of this study is two-sided. 
First, we want to validate our overall planning approaches based on the proposed Model of Execution, and thus, show how it allows successful collaboration with a human. 
Secondly, we want to validate the Model of Execution itself, that is, showing how it allows the human to always be the leader and able to decide while the robot follows concurrently. We use a simple baseline to compare the Model of Execution with, and we show how our model allows to better satisfy human preferences and thus is preferred. 

\textbf{TODO: Explicit hypothesis? Cronbachâ€™s alpha?}

We decided to conduct this study in simulation for various reasons. First, one of our assumptions is that all actions should roughly have the same duration. However, real-life robots are slow and not very reactive. Those aspects may bias the results of our study which is focused on decision-making. Secondly, simulation allows several simplifications that are acceptable for study. Collision with the cubes has been disabled to make the robot faster both in planning and executing its arm movements. In addition, simulation allows having a perfect perception of the environment. In a real-life experiment, perception errors may occur leading to replan, and thus slower execution, or even wrong decisions. Moreover, our model assumes that both agents synchronize after each step. Hence, it was easy in simulation to prevent the human from acting too soon and synchronize automatically their actions. In a real-life scenario, we couldn't physically prevent the participant from acting. This would imply a heavier training process for the participants to avoid desynchronizing with the robot. In practice, an additional execution supervisor should be developed to permit desynchronizing as long as they are not too big, and hence, prevent the system from crashing. This would require a significant technical effort to implement.

To conduct this study I developed a dedicated interactive simulator using a Tiago robot. In addition, the automaton described by the MoE has been implemented and integrated with the simulator to provide a proper execution and supervision scheme. Eventually, through carefully designed scenarios and using a shortened version of the PeRDITA questionnaire~\cite{devin_evaluating_2018} we gathered the feelings and impressions of the participants regarding the different robot behaviors. We also recorded logs from each executed scenario allowing us to draw a timeline of the execution and compute objective metrics for each scenario among which can be found: the time to complete the task, the human reaction time or the time for the human to be free. Several relevant facts and conclusions can be extracted from the collected results and are discussed in this chapter.

This chapter is organized as follows. First, the interactive simulator functionalities and operations are described. Then the methodology of the user study is provided along with anonymous information on the participants. After, the results obtained are presented and then discussed, validating the proposed hypothesis.

why simulation: HRI rebuttal: we rely on a reactive execution, real life robot are slow and not very reactive, may have perception errors, thus may bias our results focused on decision making.

Thus, we developed an interactive simulator running robot policies generated as explained the Chapter~\ref{chap:4}. Then, we conducted a user study using this simulator.

The purpose of this study is two-sided. First, we want to validate our overall planning approaches based on the proposed Model of Execution, and thus, show how it allows successful collaboration with a human. Secondly, we want to validate the Model of Execution itself, that is, showing how it allows the human to always be the leader and able to decide while the robot follows concurrently. Compared to a simple baseline, we also want to show how this model allows to better satisfy human preferences and thus is preferred. 

This chapter is organized as follows. First, interactive simulator functionalities and operations are described. After, the study protocol is presented as well as some analysis of the participants. Eventually, the obtained results are presented and discussed.

% Objective of the study is to validate the following:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Overall planning and the use of Model of Execution during planning}: Always reach the goal, with different preferences, no need of prior negotiation, overall positive interaction, simple, use of MoE allows to explore all possible execution traces and complete the robot policy allowing human free to choose any action (OptimalRatio < 1.0) while still having a reactive robot, step synchronization questionable (sometimes liked, helps participant. Sometimes a bit lost in the step, however still ok.), real scenario should use additional execution supervisor allowing step superposition.
    
%     \item \textbf{Use of Model of Execution during execution}: The MoE describes how the robot always acts in a concurrent and compliant manner with the human. This allows the human to always (at every step) be in control. By using a mirror baseline where the robot always takes the lead instead of being the follower, we show that having the robot as a follower is preferred (H feels in control) and allows for better satisfying human preferences. The drawback of this approach is that currently, the robot is always a follower, making it slower since it always waits for the human to do something to adapt and act. Given to good results of the RF (with correct estimation) the question arises of trying to mix both approaches, having a robot that is by default a follower but sometimes takes the lead to be faster (when no risk of conflict?)
    
%     \item \textbf{Neither HA-planning nor compliant execution are sufficient alone}: Indeed, when the robot follows the HF regime with an incorrect estimation of human preferences the human can ``impose'' their decisions on the robot which will adapt, and thus, the human can satisfy their preferences anyway. However, in such scenarios, the human usually have one chance to impose their decision. Hence, if they are distracted the robot will eventually act in a not desired way which can lead to negative interaction. This can be observed with some participants either getting confused or distracted, and this didn't happen when the robot had a correct estimation of human preferences. Hence, it is important to have both a pertinent robot policy/plan selection complemented with an adaptive and compliant execution to have the best interaction possible.
    
%     \item \textbf{Not investigated in this work but,} our approach has been designed to allow specifying online new human preferences, updating the whole robot policy to satisfy the new given preferences. This allows either the human to directly specify their intents and preferences to the robot, or, an external process estimating online the human preferences.
% \end{itemize}

% The goal is to validate our approach presented in the previous chapter and justify the following. We believe that the robot should plan its actions with a compromise of optimizing the task efficiency, maximizing social criteria and satisfying human preferences while collaborating with humans. However, satisfying those social criteria is challenging since they cannot be accurately quantified. Especially for human preferences which can fluctuate a lot depending on their mood and context. That is why we believe, in addition to planning the best course of action using all these criteria, it is relevant or even mandatory for the robot to adapt and be compliant with human online decisions and actions. 

% Hence, this study aims to show two main things. First, during execution, the robot should adapt and be compliant with the human actions. Indeed, it is hard to accurately estimate human behavior and preferences. In case of incorrect estimation, having a compliant robot helps to satisfy the human preferences (HF vs RF, better answers). Also, the human may act differently than expected by the robot, the latter should be able to allow this and comply with it (ratio\_h\_optimal < 1.0).
% Secondly, the study validates our overall planning (and execution?) approach. The goal is always solved. The collaboration is always useful (more or less) and not so low (positive). 
% Third, we can also say that despite having to be compliant online, it is very beneficial to plan correctly beforehand the robot actions. 

% \textbf{TODO: GOAL of the study is to validate two things. First, our overall planning approach. Secondly, the HF model of execution. 1) Should see that overall even when wrong RF the robot isn't so bad, still useful, simple, competent, responsive. Could do better and a bit frustrating but still ok to accomplish the task. 2) Should see that HF is significantly preferred and results in more acceptable and appreciated behavior : Adaptive, Appropriate, Accommodating, Positive.}

\subsection{Questionnaires}
Many questionnaires are used in the field of HRI. The main ones are listed here: GodSpeed, HRIES, PeRDITA, RoSAS, Trust Perception Scale-HRI. 

Each questionnaire has specificities and helps to measure certain aspects of the robot. Many include appearance items to evaluate the look of the robot. Since our focus is on robot decision-making, we decided to base our questionnaire PeRDITA. Indeed, this questionnaire has been designed to evaluate the pertinence of robot decisions in a Human-Robot Joint Action Context, which is exactly our case. Yet, the full questionnaire is a bit heavy and also covers communication which isn't our topic in this work. 
That is why we decided to shorten the questionnaire by removing the section on communication and a few redundant items. Redundant items are helpful to evaluate the consistency of a questionnaire and this has already been done in~\cite{devin_evaluating_2018}. Hence, to avoid participants getting bored and lost by filling out the whole questionnaire after every scenario we kept 12 items covering the following dimensions: robot perception, interaction, collaboration, and acting.



\section{Study protocol}

Methodology: 
Initial demographics' questionnaire to identify potential individual difference ratings. Then, presentation instructions/text. After, familiarized with simulator through an interactive tutorial. Eventually, the six scenarios in randomized order are experienced by the participant. After each scenario the participant answers a shortened version of the PeRDITA questionnaire and logs about the execution are saved. Eventually, the participant is asked about their overall impressions regarding the interaction they had with the simulated robot, and they are asked which scenario they preferred the most and the least.

This section describes the objectives and protocol of this study.  



\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Chapter6/UserStudyProcedure.png}
    \caption{A scenario of the User Study Protocol. Each participant goes through 6 scenarios and answer 6 questionnaires to evaluate each different robot behavior}
    \label{fig:user_study_protocol}
\end{figure}




Through this study we want to demonstrate the benefits of using the model of execution described in the previous chapter~\ref{chap:4} in a collaborative context. We believe this model of execution is pertinent to be taken into account when executing and supervising a robot's plan. For the same reasons we based the policy generation of this model and aim to justify our choice and validate our approach.

In this study, each participant is made to collaborate six times with a simulated robot to achieve a shared task, each time is referred to as a scenario. The robot exhibits a different behavior in each scenario. After each scenario, the participant evaluate the robot's behavior through the PeRDITA questionnaire \cite{devin_evaluating_2018}.

Beforehand, every participant answers a few general/demographic questions and is familiarized with the simulator functionalities through an integrated tutorial. Only then they start the six consecutive collaborative scenarios, answering every time a questionnaire to describe the interaction. Eventually, every participant is asked to share their general feelings and impressions about the overall interaction with the simulated robot, and they are asked to tell which scenario they preferred the most and the least.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Chapter6/task_description_study.png}
    \caption{Description of the shared task to achieve in the study.}
    \label{fig:task_description_study}
\end{figure}

We now provide details about the task, the scenarios and how the different robot behavior are generated. 
The shared goal, which is stacking the cubes to match the given pattern, remains the same in all scenarios. The cube disposition on the table also doesn't change either. The task description is depicted in fig~\ref{fig:task_description_study}. 

To progress in the task, the agents can perform three different primitive actions which are the following: \textit{pick} a cube, \textit{place} a cube in the stack, or, \textit{drop} a cube back on the table.
These actions have a few preconditions, more or less intuitive, that are communicated and experienced by the participant during the integrated tutorial.
First, one can \textit{place} a cube if they hold the cube, and if the targeted location is free and supported. That is, the cubes directly below the targeted location must be placed before being able to place a cube in the targeted location.
Secondly, one can only \textit{pick} a cube from their respective reachable zones of the table, i.e., Human and Center zones for the human, and Robot and Center zones for the robot. Also, one can only pick a cube if it can be placed immediately. Thus, one cannot pick a cube ``in advance'' and has to wait to its placement condition to be true before picking it up. For instance, both pick bars can only be picked up after the yellow and red cubes have been placed. This rule helps to create interaction conflicts serving the purpose of this study. Moreover, although the participants find this not intuitive they get used to it really fast and this feeling seems to be significantly reduced along the experiment.
Third, one can \textit{drop} a cube back on the table only if they hold it and if it cannot be placed.

For each scenario the participant is given instructions regarding how to solve the task. The participants are asked to consider these instructions as their own choice and preferences regarding the task resolution, and thus, to act accordingly while collaborating. The instructions at each scenario are one of the two following.
On the first hand, the participant shall act in a way to finish the task as soon as possible. Here, it consists in trying to perform as many actions in parallel as possible to progress faster. These preferences are latter referred to as Task End Early (TEE).
On the other hand, the participant shall act in a way to be freed as soon as possible. That is, they should finish their mandatory part of the task as soon as possible, so they could leave and let the robot finish alone. Here it consists in placing the pink bar from the Human zone as soon as possible. These preferences are latter referred to as Human Free Early (HFE).
On its side, the robot doesn't directly have access to these instructions/preferences, they are only estimated. Hence, for each scenario, the robot is given a more or less accurate estimation of the human preferences that are communicated to the participant. Note that the participants aren't aware that the robot has an estimation of their preferences, neither that this estimation can be inaccurate.
This way, we created three scenarios with different pairs of human preferences and associated estimation. In the first pair, the human shall finish the task early and the robot has a correct estimation, i.e., the robot's policy is helping the human to finish the collaborative task early. In the second pair, the human preferences remain the same, but the robot estimation is incorrect. The robot is trying, mistakenly, to minimize the human effort. As a consequence, the robot tends to pick cubes that the human could pick, preventing the human from acting and making the task completion longer. In the third pair, the human shall free themselves early, but the robot estimation is again erroneous. The robot will try to finish the task early while its priority is to place the first pink bar, which is conflicting with the given human preferences.

Additionally, in each scenario, the robot follow one of the two following execution regimes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Robot-First (RF)}: the robot always initiates actions first, and the participant take action afterwards.
    \item \textbf{Human-First (HF)}: the robot always lets the participant take the initiative, and then acts.
\end{itemize}
The \textit{Human-First} execution regime corresponds to the Model of Execution described in the previous chapter. At each step, the robot waits for the human's decision and will execute the best action that complies with it. The human always start acting first and the robot follows. On the other hand, the \textit{Robot-First} regime corresponds to a naive and straightforward policy execution where, at each step, the robot directly starts executing the overall best robot action given by the policy. The robot always starts acting forcing the human to comply. The \textit{Robot-First} regime serves as a baseline to evaluate the proposed \textit{Human-First} regime, described by our Model of Execution and used in the policy generation.
Eventually, we associate each of the three previous pairs of preferences and estimation with one of the two different execution regime. As a result, we obtain six different scenarios with six different robot behaviors named in table~\ref{tab:scenario_names}.

                                                & TEE: correct  & TEE: incorrect    & HFE: incorrect\\

\end{table}

Note that our goal is to evaluate and compare the different robot behaviors. However, at the beginning, the participants don't have any references to compare with which can influence their answers in the very first scenarios. One solution is to ask the participants to answer all six questionnaires at the end, after being familiar with the six scenarios. We consider that this option demands a too heavy mental workload to recall accurately each specific scenario, and may bias the answers. As a consequence, we decided to ask the participants to answer the questionnaire after each scenario as a draft. During the experiment, they can rectify their answers to match more accurately their feelings. At the end, using the drafts, they share their final answers for each scenario. We believe this process allows to more accurately gather the feelings of the participants. Moreover, the ordering in which the participants encounter the scenarios is uniformly randomized to prevent any order effect. 

\textbf{TODO: Give more details about the PeRDITA questionnaire (questions, goal, etc..)}

On top of the answered questionnaires, for each scenario, the interactive simulator produces logs from which we extract several metrics and an overall timeline of the execution. The timeline depicts the activities and actions of each agent along the task progression. The subjective measures done through the questionnaire are complemented with the objective metrics extracted such as the duration to complete the task, the number of human actions, the total duration of human inactivity, and more. 


There are a few restrictions on the actions that can be performed. First, an agent can only pick cubes that can be placed immediately. This means that agents cannot pick cube in advance to anticipate each other's actions. Allowing such behavior could generate a very interesting scenario. However, here we want to purposely generate some conflicts to evaluate the robot's behavior and reactions. Without this restriction, the agents would have too much flexibility in their actions and decisions which makes it harder for the conflicts to happen.  
Additionally, when holding a cube, the agents can only place the cube in the stack on back to its original place. As a result, the agents cannot displace the cube on the table to make them reachable to the other agent. This restriction has been added for the same reasons as the first one and simplifies the conflicts generation.

In this section, we share the main results obtained through the answered questionnaires and the metrics extracted from the logs.

\subsection{Assumptions}

For analysis we rely on ANOVA tests that requires data to follow a normal distribution. 

Here the data, most of the metrics, are close to following a normal distribution (checked using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling tests). Thus, parametrics tests can be applied, and we used either paired t-tests or ANOVA with repeated measures.

In the last case, Bonferroni Post-hoc-Tests are performed to identify exactly which groups are significantly different from others.



\subsection{From timeline}

\subsubsection*{Preferences satisfaction (task completion time + time to be freed)}

\begin{figure}
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Chapter6/preferences_sastisfaction.pdf}
    \caption{Human preference satisfaction. According to the scenarios, it corresponds either to completing the task as fast as possible (Pair A and B) or being free as soon as possible (Pair C). Using t-tests for paired samples, we can identify in pair B and C the criteria of preferences is significantly better satisfied. In pair A, the difference isn't significant but the completion time is slightly shorter when using RF.}
    \label{fig:preferences_satisfaction}
\end{figure}

In this study, the human preferences consist of either finishing the collaborative task as soon as possible or being free as soon as possible while letting the robot finish alone. 
Thus, to evaluate how the human preferences were satisfied, we can measure in the first case the time to complete the task and in the second case the time after which the human can leave. 

Figure~\ref{fig:preferences_satisfaction} depicts through box plots for each pair of scenarios the corresponding relevant metric to evaluate the human preferences' satisfaction. We used t-tests for paired samples for pairwise comparison. For each pair, the tests for normal distribution suggest that the data does not significantly deviate from normality, and thus parametric tests such as t-tests can be conducted.

In Pair A, in addition to completing the stack the human wants it to be completed as soon as possible. The robot has a correct estimation of human preferences. The completion time using HF and RF are shown. The completion times in S1 and S2 are roughly similar with the respective values: $mean=59.84s SD=5.83s$ and $mean=56.64s SD=6.46s$. The completion time of Scenario 1 is higher than Scenario 2. However, a t-test for paired samples showed that this difference was not statistically significant ($p = 0.055$) and there was a small effect ($d = 0.4$) according to Cohen's \textit{d}~\cite{cohen1988concepts} (small effect = $0.2$, medium effect = $0.5$, large effect = $0.8$). Thus, the RF regime allowed the human to solve the task slightly faster than the HF regime, and thus, satisfy their preferences slightly better. 
In both scenarios, the collaboration goes smoothly, and the task is achieved without trouble.

In Pair B, the human still wants the stack to be completed as fast as possible, however, the robot has an erroneous and adversarial estimation of their preferences. This time the HF regime in S3 had lower values ($M=66.62s, SD=14.87s$) than the RF regime in S4 ($M=82.82s, SD=4.42s$). This difference is statistically significant ($p < 0.001$) and there was a large effect ($d = 1.07$). This indicates that in S4 the participants' preferences were significantly less satisfied than in S3. 
Indeed, in this pair, the robot erroneously thinks that the human wants to minimize their effort. Thus, the robot ends up trying to ``\textit{steal}'' cubes from the human to prevent them from acting, thus, minimizing their effort. With RF the human has no choice and cannot act most of the time, leading to a high completion time with a low standard deviation due to the restricted human choices leading to very similar executions. With HF the robot always acts compliantly in parallel right after the human. Hence, the human is able to pick the cubes they want and that the robot wants to pick, \textit{forcing} the robot to adapt and pick other cubes. This eventually leads to executions close to S1. However, if for any reason the human doesn't pick the cubes then the robot picks them preventing again the human from acting, explaining the high standard deviation. Comments about the feelings of the participants in each of these scenarios are given in the next subsection using the answers to the questionnaire. Overall, S4 was perceived as frustrating and S3 was perceived similarly to S1 and S2. 

In Pair C, the human prefers to be freed as soon as possible. Hence, we measured the time after which the human isn't mandatory to finish the task, i.e., the time after which the robot can finish the task alone. Scenario 5 (HF) allowed the human to be free earlier ($M=22s, SD=2.35s$) than Scenario 6 (RF) ($M=65.45s, SD=9.08s$). This difference is statistically significant ($p < 0.001$) and there was a very large effect ($d = 4.43$). This indicates that the HF regime allowed the participants to satisfy their preferences significantly better than the RF regime. 
Here, the erroneous estimation of human preferences makes the robot try to place its pink bar first, which implies that the human should place their own at the top of the stack as the last cube. Such a plan forces the human to stay until the end of the task which is in direct contradiction with the actual human preferences. Hence, after placing the yellow and red cubes concurrently, both agents tend to pick their pink bar. At this point, in S5 (HF) the robot waits for the human decision, the human can place their bar and free themselves from the task, and the robot compliantly drops its pink bar before finishing the stack alone. However, in S6 (RF), the robot doesn't wait for the human decision and places its pink bar before the human can do anything, forcing them to stay until the end to place the pink bar. As a result, the S6 values are significantly higher than S5. Moreover, the participants had various reactions to the frustrating robot action of placing the pink bar before them. Some remained passive until the end while holding their bar, others would drop it to help the robot aiming to place the bar as fast as possible anyway. These various reactions led to various executions explaining the high SD of S6.

Overall, RF tends to slightly better satisfy human preferences only when the estimation is correct (Pair A), yet, the difference wasn't significant compared the HF. On the other hand, when the estimation is erroneous, HF satisfies human preferences significantly better than RF due to how compliant the robot is when using HF. This indicates that using our model of execution instead of a simplistic baseline (RF) is beneficial for collaboration in terms of satisfaction of human preferences. 

****

\textit{We should be able to show that in scenario with similar execution, i.e. in pair A with S1 and S2, RF allows to solve the task faster, thus, human preferences are better satisfied with RF. Indeed, the S1 M1 group had higher values (M = 59,9, SD = 5,95) than the S2 M1 group (M = 56,29, SD = 6,34). A t-test for paired samples showed that this difference was statistically significant, t(23) = 2,27, p = ,033, (Small Effect)
In addition, since agents have to synchronize together at each step, we are able to measure the amount of time the human has to wait for the robot. This amount should be significantly lower when using RF than HF.
The S1 M11 (Wait ns total) group had higher values (M = 2,04, SD = 0,32) than the S2 M11 group (M = 1,29, SD = 0,36). A t-test for paired samples showed that this difference was statistically significant, t(23) = 7,4, p = <.001 (Large effect)}

\subsubsection*{Ratio human optimally}
The participants were given in every scenario an objective to satisfy, to consider as their own preferences regarding the task, and that should guide their behavior. However, in practice, the explicit actions to conduct were not given, and the participants were free to act as they would. Naturally, not all participants behaved in the same way. There were differences in the reaction time of each, but also in the action decisions, leading to different execution traces. Since different execution traces influence significantly the metrics of the timeline, it is worth discussing how the participants behaved.
In the same manner as for the robot, an optimal human policy is generated for each scenario (considering the actual preferences given to the participant). Hence, it is possible to check at each step if the participant performed the optimal action or not, and thus, compute an optimal ratio which is the number of optimal human actions performed divided by the total number of human actions performed. This can help us to analyze the results and can explain some outlier values. 

Though there are no significant differences between the different scenarios, some scenarios still have a lower average optimal ratio and high standard deviation, meaning that participants tend to have more varied behaviors in these specific scenarios. 
The average number of human actions per scenario is about 7, from 2 to 10.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Optimal human action ratio per scenario}
    \label{tab:optimal_human_ratio}
    \end{table}



As depicted in the table~\ref{tab:optimal_human_ratio}, 
S6 has the lowest average optimal ratio and the highest std. deviation. In this scenario the robot places its own pink bar even though the human holds one already, preventing the human from placing it and forcing them to drop it back on the table. This surprising behavior seems to cause frustration and confusion which led to various human decisions and actions, and more likely to deviate from the optimal course of action. In practice, a significant amount of participants get confused and are passive during several steps after the frustrating robot action. Some even remain passive almost for the whole task, waiting for the robot to stack the cubes alone until the human pink bar has to be placed. This diversity in the participants' reaction is reflected in the high sd of S6.

The low SD of S4 is also noticeable. Indeed, here the robot tends to steal the cube from the reach of the human. This behavior prevents the human from acting, and thus, from making decisions. As a result, fewer decisions are taken by the human in this scenario which results in less possible deviation from the optimal course of action.

\subsubsection*{Decision time}
Participants' decision time fluctuates a lot. Especially with HF. Indeed, at every step, the HF robot waits for a defined amount of time to observe the human decision and acts accordingly. Any human visual signal received interrupts this timer. This amount of time will be referred to as the HF Timeout because after it is reached the robot considers the human as passive. This timeout was initially set to 3$s$ with the hypothesis that it should be quite small to allow fluent interaction. With a precise action in mind, the human is able to act first, otherwise, the robot fluently takes the lead and acts first. However, during the preliminary tests, the participants felt in a rush and oppressed by this relatively low timeout. Indeed, when they didn't have a precise action to perform when the step started, they didn't have the time to think properly and tended to be rushed by the timer progressing towards the timeout. Hence, we decided to increase the timeout from 3$s$ to 4$s$ which was felt way more comfortable. 

One could think about comparing the total (sum, cumulative) decision time over each scenario. However, since different human actions can lead to various number of steps, this isn't representative. (except in scenario with same execution, only use 100\% opti ratio?)

We compare the average human decision times which are measured similarly with HF and RF and as follows. After one participant finished one scenario, we measured their decision time on each step. To do so, we first consider for each step the time when the step begins, which is signaled with text, a gaze and a sound from the robot. Then we consider the time when the human sends a signal by either starting an action or by waving their hand. The duration between these two times is considered as the decision time of the human. Note that if the human remains passive (no signal until) for a step, no decision time is computed for this specific step. Then, we extract the average decision time of the participant on the scenario from all the computed ones, compute the standard deviation and get the maximum and minimum values. 

A one-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures showed that there was a significant difference between the variables, F = 5.99, p = <.001 with an effect size Eta squared $\etaÂ² = 0.2$ which corresponds to a large effect.
When doing pairwise comparisons with t-tests obtain the following results.

In pair A, S1 (HF) had lower values ($M=0.66, SD=0.41$) than S2 (RF) ($M=1.04, SD=0.58$). This difference is statistically significant ($p=0.002$) with a medium effect ($d=0.68$).

In pair B, S3 (HF) had lower values ($M=0.54, SD=0.51$) than S4 (RF) ($M=0.62, SD=0.55$). This difference is not statistically significant ($p=0.551$) with a very small effect ($d=0.12$).

In pair C, S5 (HF) had lower values ($M=0.56, SD=0.11$) than S6 (RF) ($M=0.91, SD=0.46$). This difference is statistically significant ($p=0.001$) with a medium effect ($d=0.76$).

    \caption{Average human decision time in the six scenarios. This decision time tends to be lower when using HF than with RF.}
    \label{fig:decision_time}
\end{figure}

Considering the defined scenario pairs, the reaction time with RF tends to be longer. However, this difference is statically significant only for pair C (S5-S6). This is expected because when the robot places the first pink bar the human gets confused and takes time to adapt to the situation. On the other hand, this is not reflected in S4 despite the similar confusing robot actions. Indeed, in S4 the robot ``steals'' cubes from the human reach which is confusing, but this prevents the human from acting and thus no reaction time can be computed.  

I think the overall slower human reaction time in the RF scenarios is due to the fact that the human acts after the robot. This way, the human has to pay attention to the scene and to the robot action/intentions, which is longer than only looking at the scene like in HF scenarios.   


\subsection*{Agent actions' duration}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Chapter6/action_duration.pdf}
    \caption{Average action duration of the human and robot agents over the 6 scenarios. Compared to the human action durations, the robot ones tend to be longer and have various durations.}
    \label{fig:action_durations}
\end{figure}

As depicted in fig.~\ref{fig:action_durations}, the human actions are in average significantly faster than the robot ones. In addition, the robot action durations tend to fluctuate more than the human one. This can be explained by the difference in motion execution between the avatar and the robot. The human has a simplified motion planner that simply moves the hand at a constant speed and in straight lines to the cubes or the stack. However, the robot uses a real motion planner to move its arm which is longer than the human motions. The motion planning process doesn't always found the same solutions, nor in the same amount of time. Meaning that both the motion planning duration and the motion execution duration can fluctuate. Here only the motion execution duration is considered in this metric. Note that to avoid having too much difference between the human and robot action durations, collisions with the dynamic objects are not considered in the robot motion planner, nor the objects' orientation. Hence, the robot can pick or place cubes from any angle and pass through the other cubes. When placing a cube its orientation is corrected. Collisions with the table where kept preventing the robot from picking cubes from below.  

Over all scenarios and steps, the maximum human action duration is $4.63s$ and the minimum is  $2.55s$. For the robot, the maximum action duration is $9.09$ and the minimum duration is $1.46$.

\subsection{From questionnaires}

Statistical significance. It has been commonly assumed that a statistical test demonstrates a significant difference if a p value lower than $0.05$ is obtained. However, obtaining a value lower than $0.001$ is desired. To make the p values more legible the following standard notation has been adopted:

\begin{align*}
    p > 0.05        & \Rightarrow ns ~ (\textrm{non significant})\\
    p \leq 0.05     & \Rightarrow * ~ (\textrm{significant})\\
    p \leq 0.01     & \Rightarrow ** ~ (\textrm{very significant})\\
    p \leq 0.001    & \Rightarrow *** ~ (\textrm{highly significant})\\
\end{align*}

*****

Some questions have large standard deviations, such as about the perceived ``Intelligence'', but often only on specific scenarios.

The ``Reactive'' answers are overall the same, whatever execution regime and scenario. 
Overall, based on an ANalysis Of the VAriance with repeated measures (ANOVA), all other answers than ``Reactive'' vary significantly. Post-tests show that the main differences come from scenarios S4 and S6. Those two scenarios correspond to ones where the robot has an incorrect estimation of the human preferences and is following the \textit{Robot-First} execution regime. This indicates that all HF behaviors are perceived similarly despite the erroneous estimation of the robot. It also indicates that the RF scenario with correct estimation is positively perceived, but an erroneous estimation has a significant impact on the answers when using RF.  

Except for the ``Reactive'' aspect, answers about RF have a larger standard deviation. Thus, participants tend to be more indecisive regarding RF than HF.

About ``Reactive''. A Bonferroni Post hoc test was used to compare the groups in pairs to find out which was significantly different.
Despite the significant difference in the ANOVA, no pairwise group comparison was significant in the Bonferroni Post hoc test; all p values were greater than 0,05. 

S4 and S6 received significantly worse answers than the other scenarios. It is interesting to notice that in a pair-wise manner, all other scenarios 

We notice very few significant differences on HF only.

In table \ref{tab:questionnaire_answers} there almost only significant differences in pairs involving S4 and S6. The only few other differences are the following. 
S1 is significantly more appropriate than S5. And S5 is significantly less predictable than S1 and S3
